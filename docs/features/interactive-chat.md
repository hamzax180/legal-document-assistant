# Interactive Chat

## Overview
Users can ask natural language questions about the uploaded document, and the AI will respond based specifically on that document's content.

## Key Features
- **Context-Aware**: Answers are grounded strictly in the document text.
- **Conversation History**: The AI remembers previous turns, allowing for follow-up questions (e.g., "What about the second point?").
- **Streaming-like UI**: Messages are displayed immediately, though the backend processes the full response before returning.

## Usage
Simply type a question in the input box and press Enter. The system will indicate it is "Thinking..." while it retrieves relevant sections and generates an answer.
