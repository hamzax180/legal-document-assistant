# AI Self-Evaluation

## Overview
Every answer generated by the assistant is automatically graded by a secondary AI call to ensure quality and build user trust.

## Metrics
The system evaluates each response on three criteria (1-5 scale):
1.  **Helpfulness**: Does the answer directly address the user's intent?
2.  **Completeness**: Is all relevant information from the document included?
3.  **Relevance**: Is the answer strictly derived from the provided text without hallucination?

## Mechanism
After generating an answer, the backend makes a second call to the Gemini API with the evaluation prompt. The result is parsed and displayed as a "Confidence Score" card in the UI.
